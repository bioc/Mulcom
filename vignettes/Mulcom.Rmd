Many microarray experiments compare a common control group
with several "test" groups, like in the case , for example of a time-course experiments
where time zero serves as a common reference point. The MulCom
package described here implements the Dunnett's t-test, which has been
specifically developed to handle multiple comparisons against a common
reference, in a version tailored for genomic data analysis that we named
MulCom (Multiple Comparisons) test.
The implementation includes two test parameters, namely the t value and
an optional minimal fold-change value, m, with automated,
permutation-based estimation of False Discovery Rate (FDR) for parameter
combinations of choice.

The package permits automated optimization of the test parameters to obtain the
maximum number of significant genes at a given FDR value. In this vignette we
present the rationale, implementation and usage of the MulCom package,
plus a practical application on a time-course microarray experiment.
